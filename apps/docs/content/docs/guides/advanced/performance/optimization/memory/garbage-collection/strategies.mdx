# Garbage Collection Strategies

Deep dive into garbage collection strategies for optimal React performance.

## Memory Management

Learn how to manage memory effectively:

1. **Weak References**: Use WeakMap and WeakSet for cache management
2. **Event Cleanup**: Always remove event listeners in useEffect cleanup
3. **Timer Cleanup**: Clear intervals and timeouts

## Component Lifecycle

Optimize component lifecycle for memory efficiency:

- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement proper cleanup in useEffect
- Avoid memory leaks in closures

## Advanced Techniques

- Object pooling for frequently created objects
- Lazy loading for large component trees
- Virtual scrolling for large lists
