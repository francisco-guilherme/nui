# Icons

9ui uses [`lucide-react`](https://lucide.dev/) for icons.

For a more extensive collection of icons, consider using [`Monicon`](https://monicon-docs.vercel.app/), which offers over 200,000 icons from various popular libraries.

If you are looking for animated icons, the [`pqoqubbw/icons`](https://icons.pqoqubbw.dev/) library is a great choice.
