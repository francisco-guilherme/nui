# Base Styles Test

This page tests whether the base styles defined in the theme are being applied correctly.

<TestStyles />

## What to Check

1. **Scrollbar Styles**: The scrollable area should have custom scrollbar styling
2. **Color Variables**: All semantic colors should be properly applied
3. **Focus Styles**: Tab through the buttons and input to see focus rings
4. **Root Styles**: The page background should use theme variables

## Expected Behavior

- Scrollbars should be 4px wide with muted color
- All color utilities should work with theme variables
- Focus rings should appear with proper styling
- Background and text colors should respond to theme changes
